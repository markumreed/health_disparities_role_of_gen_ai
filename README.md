# 🧬 Health Disparities Research: CCDA Synthetic Data Generator + Google Trends Tracker

This project supports research on **AI in healthcare** and **health disparities** by generating:
- **Synthetic patient records** in **HL7 CCDA XML format** using real hospital data
- **Public interest time-series data** using the **Google Trends API**

---

## 📦 Features

- Converts real structured hospital data (`healthcare_dataset.csv`) into CCDA-compliant XML
- Assigns random **ethnicity** for diversity simulation
- Includes sections for:
  - Demographics
  - Social History
  - Medical Conditions
  - Medications
  - Procedures
- Uses **Google Trends** to track search interest for key topics (e.g., AI bias, predictive health)

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Make sure Python 3 is installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas faker lxml pytrends
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place your `healthcare_dataset.csv` in the project folder.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python generate_ccda_with_trends.py
```

---

## 📂 Output

### 🗂 Synthetic Patient Files

- Files named: `ccda_realdata_patient_1.xml`, `ccda_realdata_patient_2.xml`, etc.
- Each file includes realistic structured clinical data
- Format: **HL7 CCDA XML**

### 📈 Public Interest Data

- File: `public_interest_trends.csv`
- 12-month Google Trends data for:
  - `AI in healthcare`
  - `health disparities`
  - `artificial intelligence bias`
  - `predictive health`

---

## 📊 Research Applications

You can use this data for:

- Descriptive & comparative analysis of disparities
- Bias pattern exploration for AI systems
- Public awareness correlation via search trends
- Mock simulation of EHR systems and policy testing

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Examine chronic condition frequency by ethnicity or insurance status
- Explore how billing amounts or admission types vary by demographic
- Use Google Trends data to support your argument on ethical implications
